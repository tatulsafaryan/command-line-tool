Make Node.js Command line tool, which will split large file (more than 1GB)
into small files with given size for each one. This should be command line tool,
and should be working from Terminal/CMD Command line interface:
“node program.js <large_file_path> <small file max size> <output directory>“

Example: 
node.js example.js large_file.mp4 200 ./small-files
this will split “large_file.mp4” large file into small files not more than 200KB each one.
